    "description":"One of California's most formidable natural landscapes, Yosemite National Park features nearly 1,200 square miles of sheer awe: towering waterfalls, millennia-old sequoia trees, striking, daunting cliff faces and some of the most unique rock formations in the United States. But despite its enormous size, most of the tourist activity takes place within the 8-square-mile area of Yosemite Valley. Here you'll find the park's most famous landmarks – Half Dome and El Capitan – as well as excellent hiking trails through the natural monuments. Even inexperienced hikers can enjoy Yosemite: Guided tours and climbing lessons are available from local adventure outfitters (such as those featured on our list of the best California tours). Just don't expect to experience it by yourself. Like so many other American tourist destinations, crowds are the biggest obstacles to an enjoyable Yosemite vacation – approximately 4 million people visit each year. But if you go at the right time (and start your day a little earlier than usual), Mother Nature's wonders will reveal themselves to you in a miraculous and serene way.",

The main attraction is hiking the park's 350-some miles of trails that wind through pine and spruce forests, glittering alpine lakes, swaths of wildflowers and, if you're lucky, some elk or bighorn sheep. And maybe it's the thinner atmosphere that goes to visitors' heads, but even the most jaded report feelings of awe and wonder after a day or two of breathing in that refreshing mountain air. ",

 "description":"Acadia National Park was America’s sixth most visited national park in 2021 rising two spots from 2020. In 2021 Acadia National Park saw 1.4 million more visitors than it did in 2020.Along the rocky shores of Maine’s coast you’ll find this easternmost national park. Once the exclusive domain of the gilded age elite, a few civic-minded residents decided to make Acadia’s beauty available to all Americans by donating the land to the national park service – and boy are we glad they did. With rounded mountains, shimmering lakes (called ponds here) , rugged coastline, and forests dotted with old stone roads and trails this New England national park is a real treasure.",

 "description":"Despite being ranked the best national park in America, Olympic National Park fell out of the top ten most visited national parks in 2021 to the twelfth most visited park. Olympic National Park is the most diverse national park in America, hands down. This park has everything from lowland forests, striking mountain ranges, pristine alpine lakes, sparkling rivers, temperate rainforests (the largest in North America), iconic wildlife, and over 50 miles of wild coastline! Oh, and it’s a stones throw from Seattle! Olympic National Park truly has it all and without the crowds that have become so insidious in other US national parks in recent years – which is why we rank this Pacific Northwest gem as the best national park in America.",

 "description":"Towering above Jackson Hole Valley with jagged snow-topped peaks, Wyoming's majestic Teton Mountains are in high relief at Grand Teton National Park. From the 13,770-foot Grand Teton to the glittering Jenny and Jackson lakes – which reflect the mountains in their depths – the photo-ops are endless. But the park isn't just for mountaineers and photographers. In the peak summer season, the area's trails call to hikers of all abilities and reveal gems like hidden waterfalls and breathtaking views of the Tetons. Meanwhile, the Snake River appeals to kayakers, rafters and those who simply fancy a float. Historic districts like Menors Ferry and Mormon Row attract history buffs interested in the 19th-century past of this piece of Western Frontier. ",

 "description":"Aside from its breathtaking geological features, it's also home to a fair amount of history. The Going-to-the-Sun Road – a scenic, 50-mile drive through the park – is a National Historic Landmark and an engineering marvel that offers spectacular views, as well as access to popular hiking trails. Plus, many of the park's lodges, chalets and hotels were constructed by the Great Northern Railway in the early 20th century and are on the National Register of Historic Places. Care to visit a UNESCO World Heritage Site? You'll find that here, too: the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park. Named for the remnants of glaciers from the ice age, Glacier National Park is located on the border of Canada and Montana. It is often called the 'Crown of the Continent', because of its dizzying array of natural beauty. ",
